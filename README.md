# DSPVis

User case:
Using python for presenting various DSP data and other data types. 
Specifically using extracted examples from the websites of geoplot, plotpy, matplotlib, and scipy.

Python is easy to use and many available libraries to use for various data displays, 
from plane paths to signal processing of audio signals. Many of which is shown in my sample code.
